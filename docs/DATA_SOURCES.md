# Data sources

This repo ships with a small synthetic-ish sample dataset for offline demos.

To move to real pro tennis data, a common approach is to ingest match-level CSVs
(ATP/WTA) that include player names, dates, surfaces, and outcomes.

If you want, I can add optional downloaders for well-known public tennis match
datasets and map them into the standardized schema used by this pipeline.
